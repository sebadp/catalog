I propose a scalable architecture design using a microservices approach.

The proposed architecture consists of the following components:

Product service: This service manages the CRUD operations for products. It exposes RESTful APIs for the admin users to create, read, update, and delete products. It also stores and tracks product queries made by anonymous users.

User service: This service manages the authentication and authorization of users. It also stores the user data, including the admin users' details.

Notification service: This service is responsible for sending notifications to all other admins when a product is updated. It integrates with AWS SES to send email notifications.

API Gateway: This component is the entry point to the system. It receives incoming requests and forwards them to the appropriate microservice. It also provides authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

Load balancer: This component distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the microservices to ensure high availability and scalability.

Database: This component stores all the data for the system, including the products, users, and tracking data.

The microservices architecture is scalable because each service can be independently scaled up or down based on its workload. For example, if the product service is experiencing a high load, we can scale up its instances to handle the increased load. Similarly, if the user service has less load, we can scale down its instances to reduce costs.

Also, this architecture is resilient to failures because if one service fails, the rest of the system can continue to function. Additionally, by using a load balancer and multiple instances of each service, we can ensure high availability even if some instances fail.

Overall, this architecture design is suitable for handling the current requirements and can scale to handle increased traffic and workload in the future.

We could add an Analytics Service that could be scaled in the future by using a distributed database such as Apache Cassandra or MongoDB. These databases can handle large volumes of data and can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Additionally, a caching layer such as Redis could be added to improve performance and reduce database load.
